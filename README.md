# CSDS: Construction Site Detection and Segmentation

The **Construction Site Detection and Segmentation(CSDS)** is a  tool consisting of 16 CSDS models and of large-scale dataset of construction site satellite imagery with detailed polygon annotations(5 stages and footings).  
It contains both the **raw source data** (images and XML annotations) and **preprocessed training-ready splits** in YOLO format.  

## Pretrained Models
Pretrained models are available at:

To request access, please fill out the form. Access will be provided once it has been manually.

## Data availability
The dataset is available at Digital Object Identifier (DOI) https://doi.org/10.48333/0PJD-BP65.


## Dataset Structure

- All images and annotations are provided in **ZIP archives** for efficient storage and download.  
- The `raw/` folder contains original images and XML annotations.  
- The `preprocessed/` folder contains processed input images (600px and 1200px) and corresponding annotations in YOLO-style train/test/val splits.

```

- **AOD/** â†’ Preprocessed dataset corresponding to "all objects" annotations.  
- **FVOD/** â†’ Preprocessed dataset corresponding to "fully visible objects" annotations.  
- Each size folder (`600/`, `1200/`) contains YOLO-ready **`train/`**, **`val/`**, and **`test/`** splits with `images/` and `labels/` directories.
